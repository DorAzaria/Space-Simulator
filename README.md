# Space Simulator

The interactive Space Simulator is made up of all the planets that orbit our sun.
Of course, the simulation is inaccurate since the distances between the planets and their sizes are unrealistic.
The motion was created using the following equations:

## Hohmann Transfer Orbit
Hohmann transfers provide the basis for all types of operational orbital
maneuvers. A Hohmann transfer is generally assumed to take place
between two orbits in the same plane, but its possible to use a variation of
these maneuvers to move between orbit planes as well. solving for velocity results in the vis-viva equation.
